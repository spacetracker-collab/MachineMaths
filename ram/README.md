# Machine Maths Game

A new Flutter project. This project is about developing a small game that has three elements

1) Optical Character Recognition of Traffic Number Plates. This is required manually in the game now. We can use the Reveal button to skip that option.
2) Fitting an equation to the recognized numbers. For example if the plate is 2244, you can type (2/2)=(4/4) , (2*4) = (2*4) , (2^4) = (2^4) and so on. Any one of this will clear the level and give you points.
3) The game is single user. It is proposed to have a time limit of 2 minutes (TBD) for recognition and 5 minutes (TBD) for problem solution.

This game was invented by me in 2012


# Status

This game is **under development**. I have coded in D3, JointJS, AngularJS1.2, Angular 7 and React. This game was created and done with a side objective of learning Flutter.
